# Coding-1-Final
 These are the starter files for S2021 Coding 1
This website is about me and everything I plan to do in the future. I tried to incorporate everything I have learned this semester however, that was difficult. The Homepage has a carousel that has many pictures of me and my friends throughout the year. Ithas alwaysbeen hard for me to learn to style the carousel because i never quite understoodhow to do it. The next page is the About me page andin this page i discussed my plans for the furture and it includes a picture of me. The final page is the contact page and in this page i list my contact information to get in touch with me. Thank for for teaching me throughoutthis class, I have had a lot of ups and downs but this classhas truly been an overall amazing experience. I hope to come back to visit next year!!
